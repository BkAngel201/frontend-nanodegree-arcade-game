# Game Mechanics
 - Always will be only one single enemy (Lady Bird Beetle) per line, but be careful when any enemy goes out of the screen the next one could be even faster ... or maybe not???
 - The player can move in all 4 directions **left**, **right**, **up** and **down**, but when it reaches any border it wouldn't able to continue going in that direction.
 -  The player only has 1 live so if he touches an enemy the game will be over, and the player will lose.
 -  The player only can win if it reaches the final line(Water) without colliding with an enemy.
